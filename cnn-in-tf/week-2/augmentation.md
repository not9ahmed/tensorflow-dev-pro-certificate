# Augmentation

To overcome the overfitting, we can collect more data and this will allow the model to become more generalized. However it's not always possible. So in this case we are going for Image Augmentation. It is is when you tweak the training set to increase the diversit of subjects it covers.

## Learning Objectives


- Recognize the impact of adding image augmentation to the training process, particularly in time

- Demonstrate overfitting or lack of by plotting training and validation accuracies

- Familiarize with the ImageDataGenerator parameters used for carrying out image augmentation

- Learn how to mitigate overfitting by using data augmentation techniques

## Introducing Augmentation


**Overfitting:**

Very good at spotting something from dataset, but getting confused when seeing something does not match expectations.
