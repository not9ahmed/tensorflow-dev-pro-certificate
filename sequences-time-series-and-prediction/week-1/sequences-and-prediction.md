# Sequences and Prediction


**Time Series:**
A series of data that changes across time, and how it's measure over time.

Stock prices, Weather Forecasts, and SunSpot activity.

## Time Series Examples

- stock prices
- weather forecasts
- historical trends
- Moore's law
- The number of transistors per square millimeter
- Correlation of total revenue generated by video game arcades versus computer science doctorates awarded in the United States

**What is a time series?**
An ordered sequence of values that are usually equally spaced over time.

**Univariate Time Series:**
Single value at each time stamp

**Multivariate Time Series:**
Multiple values at each time stamp.

- Can be useful for understanding the impact of related data.

## Machine Learning Applied to Time Series

**Data Imputation:**

- Projecting back into the past to see how we get where we are now
- Fill in holes for when data does not exist

### Time series prediction in Anomaly

- In website logs, to see when there's potential DDoS attack.


### Anaylze Time series to spot patterns in Them, and deteremine which generated the series itself

- Analyze sound waves to spot words in them. Which can be used fo Speech Recognition
- Using Machine Learning, it's possibel to train neural network based on time series to recognize words or subwords


## Common Patterns in Time Series

### 1- Trend

Where time series has a specific direction that they're moving in.

Moore's Law

### 2- Seasonalitiy

Where patterns repeat at predictable interval.

### 3- Combination of Trend and Seasonalitiy

There's overall upward trends, but there are local peaks and troughs/dips.

### 4- Not Predicatble/Noise

Complete set of random values producing white noise, and there's nothing to do.

### 5- Autocorrelated Time Series

#### Simple AutoCorrelated

Correlates with delayed copy of itself often called "Lag".
Often this type described having memory as steps are dependent of previous ones.
- Unpredictable spikes called "Innovations"
- They cannot be predicted on previous values

#### Multiple AutoCorrelated
Another example where there is multiple autocorrelation in time steps 1 and 50.
- Lag 1 gives these very quick short term exponential delays
- Lag 50 gives the small balance after each spike

### 6- Trend + Seasonality + Autocorrelation + Noise

Time series in real life often are a mixture of multiple time series type features combined.

Machine learning models are designed to spot patterns, and then we can make predictions.

Patterns in the past will continue to occur in the future.

### Non-Stationary Time Series

Something unordinary happened that caused a shift in the pattern, financial crisis (2008).

We coul train for a limited period of time. For example only on the last 500 steps.

Ideally it's better if we can take the entire model, but it's not very simple.
